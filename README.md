Insurance premium calculator with JUnit tests. Final project for Agile Software Development Methodologies module.

This program was developed at the end of the Agile Software Development module. A simple insurance premium calculator was written in Java which checks the age and number of accidents a user has had. Based on this information the insurance is loaded for younger and more accident-prone drivers. The main purpose was to design a range of Junit tests which are carried out on the insurance program such as whether the correct values are displayed for people of different ages and accident histories. A suite was also developed to run the two separate test files.

To run this project:
1 Download project folder.
2 Navigate to src/ie/atu/dip folder in command prompt.
3 Enter the command javac *.java
4 Navigate back three levels to the src folder.
5 Enter the command.. java ie.gmit.dip.InsuranceProgram (or whichever tests you wish to run.)
